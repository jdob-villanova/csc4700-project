If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I would want super-photographic memory: the ability to remember anything I see after looking at it only once. If I could do this, I could read books incredibly quick or memorize facts and formulas for classes effortlessly. I could always remember faces of people I meet (which I suck at). My life would be made so much easier if I had perfect memory. It may not be flight or invisibility or anything flashy, but it is the most practical power one could have.
